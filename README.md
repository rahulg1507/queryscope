# QueryScope

> An experimental relational database engine with an interactive query-plan visualizer.

QueryScope is a database-engineering project, not a CRUD application. The long-term goal is to build a small relational database engine in Java and a React interface that makes query execution and planning visible. The database engine is intentionally not implemented yet.

## Project structure

```text
queryscope/
├── backend/       # Java/Spring Boot HTTP API
├── frontend/      # React/TypeScript web interface
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

## Architecture

The frontend runs as a separate development server and calls the backend through `/api`. The backend has distinct controller, service, model, repository, and engine packages so the future database implementation has a clear home. The parser is pure application logic: it turns SQL text into an immutable AST and never executes it.

## Tech stack

- Backend: Java 17+, Spring Boot 3.5, Maven, JUnit 5
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite, Vitest, Testing Library
- Ports: backend `8080`, frontend `3000`

No Firebase, Firestore, authentication, or external application database is used.

## Run locally

### Backend

From `backend/`:

```bash
# Windows PowerShell
.\mvnw.cmd test
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

# macOS/Linux
./mvnw test
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The API is available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend

From `frontend/`:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The web interface is available at `http://localhost:3000`. The Vite development proxy forwards `/api` requests to the backend at port 8080.

Frontend checks:

```bash
npm test
npm run build
```

## Current capabilities

- `GET /api/health` returns `{ "status": "ok" }`.
- The frontend reports whether the backend health check is reachable.
- Lexical analysis with case-insensitive `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, and boolean keywords.
- Parsing of `SELECT`, `FROM`, optional `WHERE`, comparison expressions, integer/string/boolean literals, and optional trailing semicolons.
- Immutable AST generation for supported queries.
- `POST /api/query/parse` returns the parsed AST and uses HTTP 400 for invalid user SQL.
- The frontend displays successful parses as an expandable AST tree and shows parser/backend errors clearly.
- Query execution is **not** implemented; the UI displays no query results.

Example SQL:

```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM users
WHERE age > 18;
```

Example AST response:

```json
{
  "type": "SELECT",
  "columns": [
    { "type": "COLUMN", "name": "name" },
    { "type": "COLUMN", "name": "age" }
  ],
  "from": { "type": "TABLE", "name": "users" },
  "where": {
    "type": "COMPARISON",
    "operator": "GREATER_THAN",
    "left": { "type": "COLUMN", "name": "age" },
    "right": { "type": "NUMBER", "value": 18 }
  }
}
```

## API

- `POST /api/query/parse` accepts `{ "sql": "..." }` and returns an AST for supported SQL.
- Invalid SQL returns HTTP 400 with `{ "error": "..." }`.

## API roadmap

Future API areas include query execution, `GET /api/schema`, `POST /api/tables`, and `POST /api/tables/{table}/rows`. They are not implemented yet.

## Roadmap

1. ~~SQL lexer/parser~~
2. ~~AST~~
3. In-memory tables
4. Table scan/filter/projection
5. Execution plans
6. Joins
7. Indexes
8. Query optimizer
9. Benchmarking
10. Visualization

Only lexical analysis, parsing, and AST generation from the first two roadmap items are implemented. Storage, execution, planning, and visualization beyond the current AST tree remain future work.
